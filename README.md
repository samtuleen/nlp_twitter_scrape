# Twitter Scraper - NLP (Natural Language Processing)

Twitter, along with other social media platforms, represents an immense and largely untapped resource for data. An invaluable source of user information and public realtime data on almost every topic in today's world, Twitter remains the most popular platform for research, as it still provides its data via a number of APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces.

# What is Natural Language Processing, or NLP?

**Natural language processing (NLP)** refers to the branch of computer science—and more specifically, the branch of artificial intelligence or AI—concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can. NLP has become an essential business tool for uncovering hidden data insights from social media channels. Sentiment analysis can analyze language used in social media posts, responses, reviews, and more to extract attitudes and emotions in response to products, promotions, and events–information companies can use in product designs, advertising campaigns, and more.

A number of tools can be utilized using the data that Twitter provides us, including but not limited to Natural Language Understanding (NLU), which analyzes text in unstructured data formats.

This project will show how to scrape tweets related to COVID-19 from Twitter using Twitter APIs. In this README, I will demonstrate how to create an API Key, SecretAPIkey, Accesstoken and secret access token to securely store and use for scraping tweets. You can find it below. 

The repository contains a README and a [notebook](https://github.com/samtuleen/nlp_twitter_scrape/blob/main/twitter_scraper.ipynb) for a twitter scraper.
